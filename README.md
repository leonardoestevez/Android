Android Application for Rekam1 Devices

This application provides a push button UI to send rekam1 commands to a rekam1 compatible platform over Bluetooth.
It also includes a simple graphing mechanism to present returned data and an x,y accelerometer virtualization 
which sends "put pin value" commands as the phone is tilted when enabled.

The source files are built into an Android application with "Basic4Android" which is available from the Android market.
